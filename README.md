- **List All Files**: The platform provides a list of all uploaded files, making it easy for users to find and manage their files.

- **Upload New Files**: Users have the capability to upload new files, expanding the content available on the platform.

- **Change File Permissions**: File permissions can be modified, allowing users to control who can access and view specific files.

- **View Files**: Users can view the content of files directly within the platform.

- **Generate Thumbnails for Images**: For image files, the platform automatically generates thumbnails, improving the user experience.
